# Snake-AI
AI and Machine Learning for the Snake Game.

#Abstract

This whitepaper outlines the development of an AI-driven Snake game using adaptive AI and procedural generation techniques. The goal is to enhance the classic Snake game by incorporating AI that learns from player behavior and procedural generation to create unique and challenging levels.

#Introduction

The Snake game has been a staple of video gaming since its inception. By integrating AI and procedural generation, we aim to modernize this classic game, making it more engaging and challenging. The AI will adapt to player strategies, while procedural generation will ensure that each game session offers a unique experience.

#Technical Considerations

Game Development Frameworks The game will be developed using a robust framework that supports 2D games and allows for easy integration with AI models. The choice of framework will ensure smooth development and deployment.
AI and Machine Learning
Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) will be the primary technique used to train the AI. The AI agent will learn to play Snake by receiving rewards for actions that lead to higher scores and penalties for actions that result in game over. This approach allows the AI to improve its performance over time by learning from its experiences.
Neural Networks A neural network will be used to approximate the decision-making process in the RL algorithm. The network will take the game state as input and output the best possible actions. Training the network involves adjusting its parameters to minimize errors in decision-making.
Procedural Generation
Level Design Procedural generation will be used to create unique levels for each game session. This involves generating obstacles and food items in a way that ensures a balanced difficulty level, providing a fresh experience every time the game is played.
Adaptive Difficulty The procedural generation algorithm will adapt the difficulty based on the player’s performance. For example, if a player consistently achieves high scores, the algorithm will generate more complex levels to provide a greater challenge.
Core Mechanics of the Snake Game
Movement and Growth The core mechanic of the Snake game involves controlling a snake that moves around the game board, growing in length each time it consumes a food item. The player must navigate the snake to avoid collisions with the walls, obstacles, and its own body.
Scoring System The scoring system is based on the number of food items consumed by the snake. Each food item increases the score and the length of the snake, making the game progressively more challenging as the snake grows.
Game Over Conditions The game ends when the snake collides with the walls, obstacles, or its own body. These conditions create a balance between risk and reward, as players must carefully navigate the snake to maximize their score without causing a collision.
Power-Ups and Special Items To add variety and strategic depth, power-ups and special items can be introduced. These items might temporarily increase the snake’s speed, provide a shield against collisions, or offer bonus points. The inclusion of such elements can make the gameplay more dynamic and engaging.
